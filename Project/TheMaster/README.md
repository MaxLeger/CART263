# CART253 FINAL PROJECT: ESCAPE LAB
## MGL

ARTIST'S STATEMENT:

The goal of this project was to craft an immersive puzzle experience. Through imagery and music, the user is transported into an unexpected situation. A sequence of panels containing animated assets sets the tone and provides context to the user. I am content with how the story unfolds through visual storytelling and the overall absurdity of the circumstances.

Going to the extremes:
-	Using very simple vector drawing: Undetailed, but obvious in appearance.
-	Using highly detailed photography.

By mixing those two extremes, I strived to set a comical tone / a cartoon feel; reenforcing the absurdity of the situation.

Once the user finds himself into to the crafting area, he is able to interact with the on-screen components and use them to further create new components. The goal was to create a simple and intuitive combination mechanics.
I believe this objective was achieved. It was made apparent to me when my family game tested the simulation.
